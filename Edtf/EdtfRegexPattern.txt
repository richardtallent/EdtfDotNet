(?x)

# This RegEx pattern recognizes valid EDTF base dates, i.e., dates without any
# intervals, sets, choices, before/after flags, etc. It handles all valid dates
# for Levels 0, 1, and 2.
#
# The intent of this pattern is parsing, not strict validation. It will, for example, allow a seasonal
# qualified for a normal month, or a day/time for a season, neither of which is actually allowed.
#
# Named groups are created for the following:
#
#	year		The entire year, including opening and closing parenthesis, etc. but not flags
#	yearnum		The year number, including sign, exponents, and precision
#	yearflags	The end of the year flags
#	month		The entire month, including parenthesis, but not flags
#	monthnum	The month number
#	seasonqualifier		The optional qualifier for seasons (seasons cannot have days or times)
#	monthflags	The end of the month flags
#	day			The entire day, including parenthesis, but not flags
#	daynum		The day number
#	time		Time in common HH:MM:SS(Z|+-HH:MM) format, which can be parsed natively by .NET easily
#
#	Since only the year is required, the other named groups may not exist.
